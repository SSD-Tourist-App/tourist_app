Reviews
I could have bought a ton of stuff in this store.  They had "real" antiques that were reasonably priced and fairly grouped together.  If you are ever in Las Vegas this place is definitely worth a stop!

Great vintage jewelry, fun walk down memory lane. Owners are super friendly, knowledgeable, and have great prices. Launching point of the Rough Riders and the train ride to the  Cuban American War.

Bordering the the old, central plaza and situated near the Plaza Hotel, this antique shop intrigued my wife and I for nearly 90 minutes as we roamed through the store. Has all sorts of local antiques, old western goods, and many other items. Worth a visit, especially if you're staying at the Plaza Hotel.

If you are interested in antiques this is the place for you, It's a big store and there is a lot. It's situated in the historic district right at the Plaza.

Borrowing from prolific author Bill Bryson, this is one of those places not to be missed. Best visited with a list of things you have been looking for. There is so much there it is easy to forget what you really need because you will find so much you want. Take time to browse. It's a fabulous inventory. A museum of old and unusual things. Set on the plaza used in the filming of Longmire. A beautiful historic town in the middle of the desert. 

The owners were awesome!  They have cats in the store!   Very cool.  They have an awesome collection of antiques and curios.  Super nice folks who write/edit/publish the Las Vegas and San Miguel County visitors guide.  We found the guide indispensable.  I found some vintage Harley Davidson post cards.  There was a lot to see.

And the owners are really cool, too. Definitely worth a look. I picked up a couple of pieces of jewelry at better prices than Santa Fe.

The feel of the building alone is worth a visit here. Right now I'm looking at an 1882 map/drawing of Las Vegas, New Mexico, and the building is right on the Plaza. The owners have done an excellent job of amazing interesting and useful antiques. The only reason I don't give it a full five stars is because there is so much to see, it's impossible to see it all. 

Unfortunately on this recent trip to Las Vegas NM the town seemed rather run down & depressing with way too many closed up shops and vacant buildings, but Plaza Antiques is a bright spot on a corner near the grand old hotel.  The collection is diverse and within average price ranges.  It's a great place to pick up an old bit of western hardware, rustic home furnishings or cowboy boots. The very friendly cat just begging to be petted is an added bonus to make you feel welcome.

From western collectables to vintage you will enjoy looking over everything.  Ask about the Sock Monkey collection, no it is not for sale but lots of fun to see.  

My partner and I recently and really enjoyed browsing and found a few treasures. Staff was very friendly and I love the location right on Las Vegas plaza.

Lots of very interesting items that I had never seen before. Considered purchasing a few, but had no room in the car.

Great old building with lots is stuff.   We felt it was more of a collectors bunch of miscellaneous stuff.  No furniture or high end quality pieces.   Lots and lots of little stuff. Interesting shop.
